data used in h&m code - 'transaction.csv' and 'customer.csv', 'articles.csv' - Transaction and customer data is not present in the repo due to file size limitation on github you have to put transaction and customer csv directly in the local repo when running the code

hm_data.csv is the final merged data for H&m code
